# DP-Server-Client-Project

This is a project I made during the "defensive systems programming" course, in the OpenU. 
In this project I wrote a server client application that allows the server to communicate with a theoretically unlimited amount of clients,
and have them securely (using RSA and AES encryption) send files to the server so that they could be stored in it. Then I wrote a research document
about the protocol used in the project, and why it is actually not that secure, especially exploitive using "Man In The Middle" attacks.

The code for the client application is in the client folder, and for the server application in the server folder.
Further explanations to build the server and client are provided in each folder.
