File name: transfer.info
File location: in the folder of the executable file (exe.)
The content of the file: first line - IP address + colon + port number 
second line - client name (string up to 100 characters) 
third line - the path of the file to send to the server.

after registering to the server two files, me.info and priv.key will be created, you don't need to touch them. 
They will be used for reconnecting as this user, corrupting them will lead to an attempt to register again.
